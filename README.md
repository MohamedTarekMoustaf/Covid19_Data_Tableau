# Covid19_Data_Tableau

COVID-19 Data Analysis and Visualization
This project provides an in-depth exploratory analysis and visualization of global COVID-19 data. The analysis focuses on key metrics such as total cases, total deaths, and their relationship to population, offering insights into the pandemic's impact on a global and per-country basis.

ðŸ’» Tools and Technologies
MySQL: Used for comprehensive data cleaning, manipulation, and exploratory analysis. This includes data type conversions and querying to derive key insights.

Tableau: Utilized to create dynamic and interactive dashboards and visualizations from the cleaned data.

ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
CovidDeaths.csv: The raw dataset used for this project. It contains daily records of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and other relevant metrics.

Covid19_Data_Exploratory.sql: A MySQL script detailing the data cleaning and exploratory analysis process.

Covid19_Data_Tableau.twb: The Tableau workbook containing the visualizations.

ðŸ“ˆ Analysis and Findings
The analysis was performed using MySQL to process the raw data and prepare it for visualization. Key areas of focus include:

Total Cases vs. Total Deaths: The analysis calculates the percentage of deaths relative to total cases, providing a measure of the likelihood of death if one contracts COVID-19 in a particular country. The query shows countries with the highest death rates.

Infection Rate: The project calculates the percentage of the population that has contracted COVID-19 by comparing total cases to the country's population.

Death Count by Country: The analysis identifies the countries with the highest overall death counts.

Global Statistics: The project provides an overview of the total number of cases and deaths worldwide, as well as per continent.

ðŸ“Š Visualizations
The Tableau workbook (Covid19_Data_Tableau.twb) contains interactive dashboards and charts that visualize the findings from the MySQL analysis. These visualizations allow for an intuitive exploration of the data, highlighting geographical trends and country-specific impacts of the pandemic.
